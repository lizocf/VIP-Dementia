# Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech

**VIP-381-D: Bioengineering Research conducted by Diego Toribio & Lizelle Ocfemia and advised by Professor Sam Keene.**

## Introduction

Dementia is a category of neurodegenerative diseases that entails a long-term and usually gradual decrease in cognitive functioning. 
The main risk factor for dementia is age, and therefore its greatest incidence is among the elderly. Due to the severity of the situation worldwide, institutions and researchers are investing considerably in dementia prevention and early detection, focusing on disease progression. 
There is a need for cost-effective and scalable methods for the detection of dementia from its most subtle forms, such as the preclinical stage of Subjective Memory Loss (SML), to more severe conditions like Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) itself. 

The objective of the [ADReSSo-2021 challenge](https://dementia.talkbank.org/ADReSSo-2021/) is to make available a benchmark dataset of spontaneous speech, which is acoustically pre-processed and balanced in terms of age and gender, 
defining a shared task through which different approaches to AD recognition in spontaneous speech can be compared. By utilizing this dataset, we aim to explore which acoustic features and machine learning approaches are best suited for AD-classification.
